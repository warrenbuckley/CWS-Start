CWS Start
=========

This is the new shiny MVC version of Umbraco CWS starter site package built by <a href="http://creativewebspecialist.co.uk" target="_blank">Warren Buckley, an Umbraco veteran to the platform</a>.

###Source Code Available
This package is not closed source and never ever will be. The whole purpose of this project is for people to learn how the site was built, so any compiled code is easily available by downloading the source code from the project on GitHub.

###Built on BootStrap
Due to its popularity and the vast number of themes, jQuery plugins, CSS WebFonts and such, it was a decision to use [Bootstrap](http://twbs.github.io/bootstrap/) to build the CWS Start project on â€“ rather than having to learn a new framework or a proprietary one that I would have written.

###Built for all to learn
This website package starter kit is designed for a vast number of audiences from the absolute Umbraco novice to the more veteran Umbraco user who may want to pick up a trick or two. So why not take a look through the well documented & commented code and pick up something new today?

###Goals
The goal of this package or starter website for Umbraco, is to allow people to be able to get setup easily with Umbraco and understand one way of building a site with MVC using the Umbraco CMS platform.
So I highly encourage you to take a look through the source code and understand how it all works and even you veteran Umbraco users may pick up a trick or two perhaps.
